Here is my code for Week #1's activity: Flask To Do.

As a preparation for this class, I've been learning a bit HTML/CSS on the side. I thought it would be fun to implement a bit of what I was learning there
into this activity -- so I added a "static" folder that holds some CSS code I used for formatting this activity!

Because of that, since I am still learning CSS, I found that the following sites were very handy:
    - https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp : Basics of CSS coding
    - https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav.asp : I specifically went to the "navbar" section to create the navbar on the top of the screen.
    - https://university.webflow.com/courses/webflow-101-crash-course : During the week in between the last course 
        and this one, I was learning Webflow (in particular this tutorial, which I am still working on!).
        This tutorial is where I started learning about what elements are called what, and how they relate to other
        elements on the page.
